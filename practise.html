<h1>Fire Blazing</h1>
<body>
<p>fire in our souls make us move in different directions making us meet diffrent people leading us to change our behaviour according to the people who surround you and the cicumstances that hold you.The fire in each and every persons soul burns differently as for others it is more stronger making them to be able to resist the forces that make people to change.Each person can make their fire burn bright as the others as long as that person believes in him or herself.Im not talking about some dumb shit as doing some shit so that you can make that fire light up im talking about you taking your own initiative to make yourself stronger stand up for your believes and even when people hate you before asking yourself why they hate you ask yourself why you give a fuck.In the end run make sure that all those people who hated you, pulled you down and all the haters spell your name right because that is your legacy that you will leave behind.</p>
